# Codefellowship
Building an Android health tracker app. The features are built out over the next several labs.
## Feature Task

### lab 26 - Feature Tasks

#### Finger Exercises
One key part of health is building finger strength and endurance.

On the main page, display a number and a button. The number should increase when the button is clicked.

#### Stopwatch

On the main page, add a stopwatch.

Have a button to `[Start/Pause]` and `Reset` the clock. The start/pause button should toggle between saying "start" and "pause". And you should only be able to reset when the stopwatch is paused.

Have the view udpate as fast as possible while still leaving the buttons responsive

Display the clock as `0:00:00.000` so it should be able to track up to 9 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds, and 999 miliseconds.

#### Inspiring Image Carousel

Display an image carousel with caption. Allow users to cycle through images and read captions. Pressing next should go to the next image and its caption, pressing prev should go back

The app should display a `(1/N)`, `(2/N)` indicator so users know how many items are in the list.
